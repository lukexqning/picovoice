# Question 2

To reduce the number of API calls to only 1, we trade speed for storage. By storing all the necessary information of all the countries provided by the API, we can do a local search through < 300 records for the desired country. This is far less taxing on the user's network and allows for fast repeated search. The downsides are the need for local storage and the lack of ability for fuzzy searches for countries.
